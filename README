Featured Article Link Rot Bot (FA RotBot) is a bot that helps with Link Rot in Featured Articles and Lists on Wikipedia. FA RotBot creates a list of articles from 'Category:Featured articles' and 'Category:Featured lists'. It then sends this list to 'User:InternetArchiveBot' (IABot) for processing via the IABot API. FA RotBot does not make edits itself. FA RotBot runs automatically on a regular time schedule via cron.

The bot contains three GNU Awk programs, each are standalone command-line utilities. wikiget.awk is a generic tool for accessing various MediaWiki API functions, including the "-c" option for category lists used in this application. iabget.awk is a standalone utility for accessing the IABot API, including the "submitbotjob" function. farotbot.awk is the bot itself which calls the other two programs.
