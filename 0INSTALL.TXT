FA RotBot

Setup for 'FA RotBot'
======================

The setup instructions assume mirroring the same setup as the bot was made originally. If using 
a different name from 'FA RobtBot' change in locations as needed.

Install GNU Awk 4.1 or later
Install PHP 5.5.9 or later
Install jq 1.4 or later 

1. Create an account on Wikipedia User:FA RotBot
2. If the userid is new and doesn't have Confirmed user permissions, apply for it in two places:
       enwiki: Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed
       meta  : https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Steward_requests/Miscellaneous
3. Apply for an OAuth consumer owner-only registration:
      https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:OAuthConsumerRegistration/propose
       . Check the box "This consumer is for use only by.."
       . IP Ranges and Public RSA Key should be left empty 
4. If using Toolforge, create a LDAP account on toolforge if not already.
      https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Getting_Started
   Create a new tool called FARotBot
      https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/profile/settings/accounts
      . Go to "Tools" menu and "Create new tool"
   ssh into Toolforge then 'become farotbot'
   If not using Toolforge, create a home directory for farotbot on your system
5. Create three sub-directories:
     mkdir bin
     mkdir data
     mkdir meta
6. Download all files from GitHub into the bin directory
7. Edit wikiget.awk
     . Change the first hash-bang line to the location of GNU Awk 
     . Search for "/usr/bin/wget" and change the path if needed
8. Edit iabget.awk
     . Change the first hash-bang line to the location of GNU Awk 
     . Change the paths for the Exe["program"]'s listed. Example:
           Exe["rm"] = "/bin/rm"
     . Add the provided Keys and Secrets from step 3 (search on Oauth)
     . Set the Home and Agent strings
9. Edit farotbot.awk
     . Change the first hash-bang line to the location of GNU Awk 
     . Change the paths for the Exe["program"]'s listed.
     . Change the Home directory, email, etc.. to customize
     . Setting 'TestingLimit = 2' is recommended for initial testing 
10. Run 'crontab -e'
      55 * * * *   /usr/bin/jsub -N cron-tools.farotbot-1 -once /data/project/farotbot/bin/farotbot.awk
    This will run the program once an hour at 55 minutes after. Configure as needed.

Operation
===========

Each time the bot runs it generates data files in the data subdirectory and an index in the 
meta directory. These are logs basically and not essential for the bot to run.

If it generates a jobcompleted error, clear (ie. delete) the data directory and index file entry for the prior run and/or the run that isn't working, and try again.
